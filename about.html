<h2>About Me</h2>

<img itemprop="image" class="img-rounded about_perfil" src="/assets/img/avatar.jpg" alt="My profile">

<div class="aboutme">
  <p>I'm an infrastructure developer from Vancouver, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I mostly use Kubernetes (EKS), CloudFormation, and Jenkins at work but I like to learn about all kinds of things I don't understand. I'm also trying to learn Go in my spare time when I'm not playing Overwatch or listening to podcasts</p>

<h2>About the Blog</h2>

<div class="aboutme">
  <p>I started this blog to document all the things I've learned and to write the blog posts I wish I had access to when I was trying to learn everything. </p>
